* Approach

1. vectorize all unique lines, load into postgres. line and vector.
2. count line occurance, add to table. line and count.
3. for similar counts find co ccurances.  for count >N, find ones in a range of +/- %
   
So take begin_src end_src babel blocks

using emacs org babel mode, write an inline elisp script that traverses the current document and
finds the previous block of data and parses it.

** programming languages
use python to sum the numbers in the following table.

4. for variations ignoring whitespace, removed the whitespace differences in the data
   or other changes replace one line with another to fill in missing.
5. construct graph of lines as grammar, treat lines as tokens, tokenize and compare.
6. create windows around lines, create ngrams of lines.
7. tokenize in org mode, and construct json from pandoc.
