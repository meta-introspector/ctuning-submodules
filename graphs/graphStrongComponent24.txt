Once upon a time, there was a team of developers working on a project that required the use of ZenML, an open-source platform for building and deploying machine learning models. The team was using version 0.45.2 of ZenML when they encountered a series of issues that affected their ability to work effectively.
The first issue they encountered was that version 0.44.0 had been removed from PyPI, the Python Package Index, due to an issue with the Alembic library, which is used for database migration in ZenML. This meant that the team could no longer use that version of ZenML and had to upgrade to a newer version.
The second issue was that when they upgraded to version 0.45.2, they started experiencing issues with their machine learning models not working as expected. They soon realized that there were a number of changes that had been made in the new version of ZenML that were causing problems with their code.
To resolve these issues, the team had to make several changes to their code and upgrade to version 0.45.3 of ZenML. They also had to disable implicit authentication methods for service connectors by default, which was a security feature that caused problems with their code. Additionally, they had to update the dependencies and integration versions of their project to ensure that everything worked together seamlessly.
Despite these challenges, the team persevered and was able to successfully upgrade to the latest version of ZenML and resolve all of the issues they encountered. They learned a valuable lesson about the importance of keeping track of updates and changes when working with software, and made sure to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the future.
