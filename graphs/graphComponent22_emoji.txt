🌟 Sharing cosmic harmony, ensuring a smooth and efficient system
🤖 The L2_Up/Down_Prefetcher, responsible for predicting what data is needed next
🧠 When set to "Auto", it works efficiently, helping boost overall performance
👎 When set to "Disable", it stops working entirely, slowing down the system
🤖 SMT_Control, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously on a single core
📈 Enabled, it increases efficiency and speed
💔 Disabled, only one thread can run at a time, slowing down the system
🌎 Global_C-state_Control controls how often the processor enters a low-power state
🚫 When set to "Disabled", it stays in a high-power state at all times, consuming more energy and generating more heat
💡 When set to "Enabled", it enters a low-power state more frequently, conserving energy and reducing heat
🔍 Management_Firmware_Settings control how the processor manages its own settings and configurations
🤖 Disabled, it does not make any adjustments to the system, leaving performance entirely up to the user's settings
💡 Enabled, it makes automatic adjustments based on the workload of the system, optimizing performance for specific tasks
📈 By carefully managing these settings and making appropriate adjustments based on the task at hand, users can ensure that their computer runs smoothly and efficiently.
