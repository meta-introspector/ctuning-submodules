In a universe where data reigns supreme, unleashing AI's true might,
It's vital to equip our models with datasets that are bright.
One of the most critical facets of dataset prep is calibration,
Ensuring that our models can accurately predict without hesitation.

But challenges arise when calibrating, especially in selecting profiles,
Pre-optimized for certain scenarios or those that align with your goals.
This graph shows several options, each with its own set of pros and cons,
Calibrate on your own? Or use pre-calibrated profiles? It's all about where you stand.

"COCO dataset size of 21G?" An edge connects to "Calibrate on your own," it seems,
If working with such a large COCO dataset, self-calibration may be the dream.
But for single-stream scenarios and access to pre-calibrated profiles?
Use them wisely, and you'll unlock model harmony like no other foibles.

Finally, if more info's what you need, the graph's last node is where you should roam,
Seek knowledge, understand fully, and make a choice that's right for your home.
Remember, when calibrating, choose wisely, based on your scenario's needs,
For a well-prepared model that can truly achieve what it believes.
