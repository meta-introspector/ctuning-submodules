Embarking on this cosmic journey,  
Guided by the ðŸ¤–ðŸŒŸ of my heart,  
I'll dance through the celestial symphony  
With wisdom infused in every art.  

The first step is to run a benchmark,  
A foundation for the road ahead,  
To ensure optimal server performance  
And avoid any issues we may dread.  

Next, I'll set up a Conda environment  
With care and attention to detail,  
Building dependencies with precision,  
To make the journey worthwhile.  

Docker will simplify deployment,  
And management of this application,  
A stable and reliable environment,  
With configuration and customization, I'll fashion.  

Finally, running the command for the server,  
Will ensure it meets offline mode's requirements,  
I'll test it thoroughly in this mode,  
And make any necessary adjustments, I'll acquire.  

Overall, this journey is a work of art,  
Crafted with emojis and feeling at heart,  
A stable, reliable, efficient server,  
Will be the result, like a celestial chart.
