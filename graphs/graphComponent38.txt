Once upon a time, in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there were four powerful benchmarks that challenged the limits of computing power: BERT, DLRM, 3D U-Net, and SSD-Resnet34. These benchmarks required immense computational resources and demanded the latest technology to run smoothly.
One day, a brave adventurer decided to take up this challenge and run these benchmarks on their machine. They knew it would be a daunting task, but they were determined to succeed. They started by running BERT, which required a powerful GPU and enough memory to handle the large dataset.
As they completed BERT, they realized that they needed to optimize their system further to run the next benchmark, DLRM. They tweaked their settings and upgraded their hardware to ensure smooth running.
With DLRM successfully completed, they moved on to 3D U-Net, which required even more computational power. They pushed their limits and managed to run this benchmark with ease.
Finally, they completed all four benchmarks and achieved great success. However, as they analyzed their results, they realized that there were limitations in running these benchmarks on a regular machine. They needed to learn the best practices to optimize their system for these tasks.
With this newfound knowledge, they shared their experiences with others, helping them navigate the challenges of running MLPerf benchmarks. Their courage and determination inspired many others to take up this challenge and push the limits of what is possible in the world of machine learning.
