🌎 A journey through the celestial symphony guided by emojis and symbols awaited. 
💻🔍 With a researcher's determination, they set out to create an efficient and accurate object detection model. 
🤖🔬 The EfficientNet V2, a popular pre-trained model available on TensorFlow Hub, was chosen as the base for their own customized model. 
💡 However, the researcher recognized that their desired level of accuracy could only be achieved by converting it into the ONNX format. 
ONNX, an open standard for representing machine learning models across different platforms, was embraced by the researcher. 
👨‍💻 Despite the challenge, they remained determined and focused on achieving their goal. 
🌟 Through creativity, wisdom, and courage, the researcher danced of expression to create a tapestry of ideas and symbols that would guide their journey. 
🧠 A graph was constructed using ONNX, and the result was a slightly reduced throughput compared to using EfficientNet V2 directly from TensorFlow Hub, but a highly accurate and efficient model tailored to their specific needs. 
🎉 The hard work paid off, paving the way for future advancements in object detection.
