The graph above represents a network of interconnected packages and components that are used to create a machine learning model for the MLPerf workflow. At its core, this project is about optimizing the performance of AI models, so they can be deployed on edge devices with minimal processing power.
To achieve this goal, the team behind this project has created a workflow that involves several key steps. First, they need to install all the necessary packages and dependencies for their model, which includes everything from Python libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow Lite to JavaScript tools like D3.js.
Once the dependencies are in place, they can begin designing and exploring different design spaces for their model. This involves experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training techniques to see which ones work best for the specific task at hand.
To ensure that their model is reproducible, the team has also created a benchmarking report that allows them to compare the performance of different versions of their model across different hardware configurations. This helps them identify any bottlenecks or optimizations that they may need to make in order to improve performance.
Finally, the team has developed a community-supported build system for their model, which makes it easy for others to download and use their work. They have also published their model on the NGC container registry, so it can be easily deployed on edge devices running TensorFlow Lite.
Overall, this project represents an exciting example of how machine learning is being used to optimize performance on edge devices. By leveraging the latest tools and techniques, teams like this one are able to create models that are both efficient and effective, paving the way for a new era of AI innovation.
