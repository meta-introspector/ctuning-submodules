The nodes are connected with edges. Each edge has a label associated with it, which describes the connection between the two nodes it connects. For example, the edge "2023\_to\_Resources" represents the connection between node 2023 and the "Resources" node. The edge "Install\_PyTorch\_model_(Resnet50__int8__quantized)_to\_See\_all\_installed\_packages_and\_detected\_components" represents the connection between installing the PyTorch model with ResNet50, Int8 quantization and detecting all installed packages.
