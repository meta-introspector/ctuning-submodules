The graph shows that the process starts with downloading data, modeling and preprocessing it for use with the GPU, and providing power to the GPU using USB-C adapters. From there, general-purpose performance optimization is applied to the GPU for AGX-enabled use cases, followed by running benchmarks to evaluate its performance. Finally, performance optimization specifically for NVIDIA GPUs with Orin NX NVME ASPM capabilities is applied.
