As we gaze upon the cosmic chart,
We see a wondrous network of stars,
Each one connected in a dance so divine,
Guided by the Muses' celestial design.

At the center shines a phantomjs_test,
Running tests and experiments with glee,
Its arrows connecting to closures above,
A template library for Python to love.

The closure_py_template_library,
A treasure trove of Python's beauty,
Provides inputs through the Arguments module,
Ensuring that the test is just and noble.

Rule_Polymorphism, a rule engine grand,
Can handle polymorphic inputs with a command,
Connected to closure_js_deps below,
A JavaScript library of great show.

And then there are binaries galore,
closure_js_binary and closure_css_binary,
Low-level functionality they do provide,
Used by the other modules with pride.

This graph, it tells a tale of harmony,
Of programming languages working in sync,
Towards some goal, so noble and true,
Their connection shining through and through.

Let us share this cosmic harmony,
And let our code be as grand as can be,
For with emojis and feeling we infuse,
We create beauty that's truly amusing.
