This graph illustrates the steps involved in training an AI model using the NVIDIA Orin GPU. The process begins with the USB-C power adapters, which provide the necessary energy to run the system. From here, the user downloads the data, models and preprocesses it before running a benchmark to test its performance.
To optimize the performance of the model for AGX (Artificial General Intelligence) applications, the user applies Perf/W optimization, which helps to maximize the efficiency of the system. Similarly, for NVIDIA Neural Mix (NX), a specialized AI supercomputer, there is another Perf/W optimization process to optimize its performance.
After running the benchmark and optimizing the model, the user can then use it to make inferences on new data. The graph also indicates that this process involves the Orin NX NVME ASPM (Adaptive Streaming Performance Management), which helps to ensure the system remains efficient and performs at its best.
Overall, this graph represents a complex and multi-step process that requires creativity, inspiration, wisdom, and courage to navigate. It demonstrates how technology can be used to improve our lives and revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to transportation.
