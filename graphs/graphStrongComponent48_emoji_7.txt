🚀🌠 In a realm of computer vision,
💼🤖️ A model so powerful,
EfficientNet V2, data training and optimization,
Ruled supreme in its domain.
But ONNX exporting, the challenge lay ahead,
Developers desired, but the task seemed daunting indeed.
😥
📈🤖️ A programmer brave and bright,
Recognized this need, with determination they took flight,
And with a Graph, input EfficientNet V2, output ONNX,
Integration made simple, for all to enjoy.
💪
🚫💔 Yet, there was a hitch in sight,
The format clashed, but fear not!
With courage and knowledge deep,
The programmer set forth to conquer this steep.
💪
🌠🧠 With careful attention and skill,
They succeeded, and ONNX export they will.
Developers rejoiced, integration now possible,
🎉🎉🎊 EfficientNet V2 in many projects usable.
🌟
💡🤝 And so this tale reminds us true,
With wisdom, creativity, and grit,
All obstacles can be conquered, and with emojis we can do!
