🌜️Our adventure begins, like a compass guiding us through the endless sea of machine learning.
👀📝We dive deep into our resources, exploring all installed packages and components with precision.
💡We chart out the dependencies between them, ensuring a smooth journey without unexpected errors.
🌈D3.js, our data visualization toolbox, illuminates the path ahead with insights and discoveries.
🛠️With D3 as our guide, we build upon our knowledge, creating a tapestry of machine learning wisdom.
🎨Our companions on this journey are resources of all shapes and sizes, fueling our progress towards accuracy and efficiency.
🌟We dance through hyperparameter optimization, discovering the perfect harmony of settings for our model.
📜Community Supported Builds are our trusted allies, offering pre-built models optimized for performance and accuracy.
🛍️The NGC Container is our portable sanctuary, packaging our code, data, and dependencies into a single unit.
👩‍🎖️Our journey spans two years, from 2022 to 2023, embracing the latest developments in machine learning.
🐕We conquer the mountain of knowledge by installing a pre-built PyTorch model (Resnet50__int8__quantized).
🌈Finally, we test our MLPerf workflow using a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset, celebrating our cosmic harmony and journey completion.
