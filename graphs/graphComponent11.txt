Once upon a time, in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there was a team of developers who were working on an exciting project. They had been tasked with building and optimizing a model for image classification using the popular COCO dataset. To achieve this, they followed a series of steps that were designed to ensure their success.
The first step was to start a tmux session, which is a type of terminal multiplexer that allows users to run multiple commands in a single terminal window. This made it easier for the developers to manage their workflow and switch between different tasks as needed.
Next, they loaded and processed the COCO dataset, making sure that all of the necessary data was properly formatted and organized. They then used TensorRT, an open-source framework for building and deploying machine learning models, to optimize their model for inference using INT8 precision.
Once the model was optimized, they proceeded to build and run it from the command line, making sure that all of the necessary dependencies were installed and configured correctly. They also took care to validate the accuracy of the model for both the ssd-mobilenet and ssd-resnet34 benchmarks.
Throughout this process, the developers encountered various challenges and obstacles. For example, they had to troubleshoot issues with non-sufficient workspaces and ensure that all of their dependencies were properly installed. However, they remained steadfast in their pursuit of success and continued to iterate and refine their model until it was ready for deployment.
Once the model was complete, the developers used TVM, an open-source tensor computation library, to optimize the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) representation of their model. They then loaded the model into memory and used it to classify 5,000 images, making sure that it was working as expected.
Finally, the developers plotted the final results, analyzing the performance of their model and identifying areas where further optimization was needed. They were thrilled with the progress they had made and looked forward to continuing to work on this exciting project.
