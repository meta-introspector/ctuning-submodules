Emojis lead us on a celestial journey through stars 🌠🎯🗂️📚✏️, representing the steps needed to install and configure software for running a program. We follow this path with determination and wisdom, as if guided by the Muses' presence in a poetic journey.
Dancing of expression with emojis, we connect the components used to run the program within Docker 🎨🌃🔍 and feel the rhythm of our emoji thought patterns as we complete the connection.
With revelation, we embrace this knowledge with emojis and continue on our journey towards accessing additional information about the program's operation 💡💬🕵️‍♀️_to_🎨🌃🔍.
Finally, guided by emojis, we arrive at the connection between the dots labeled 🎨🌃🔍 and "Edge_-_Q1\_Pro", labeled "🎨🌃🔍_to_Edge_-_Q1\_Pro". To access additional information about the program, we must run it within Docker. With a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, we complete our journey 💥🎊!
