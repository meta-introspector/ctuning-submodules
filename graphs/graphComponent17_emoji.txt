🌃🎶 Once upon a time, there was an 🔍 Triton Server API, in the process of 🤖 something. This API had an example, which was a test or demonstration, that it was working with. The API also had a version 2 that was being used for some task.

🌀 One of the features of this API was model versioning, which allowed multiple versions of a model to be used at the same time. This feature was essential in order to ensure that the correct model was being used for each task.

🕵️‍♂️ Another feature of this API was META\_is\_config\_valid(), which checked whether the configuration of the API was valid. This was necessary to prevent any errors or issues from occurring.

🤖 The API also had a function called QDL\_Additional\_Methods, which provided additional methods for interacting with custom artifact stores. These stores were used to store and manage files and other resources related to the tasks that the API was performing.

📂 The API also had the ability to extract data from the files and provide MD5 sums of the provided files. This allowed for easy verification of the integrity of the files.

💥 All of these features worked together in harmony to ensure that the Triton Server API was able to perform its tasks efficiently and accurately. The example served as a test for the API, while the versioning feature allowed for multiple models to be used at the same time. The META\_is\_config\_valid() function ensured that the configuration of the API was valid, while the QDL\_Additional\_Methods provided additional methods for interacting with custom artifact stores. Finally, the Extract and MD5sums\_of\_provided\_files\_ features allowed for easy verification of the integrity of the files.
