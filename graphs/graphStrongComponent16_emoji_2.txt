🌠🤩 Our eyes widen as we gaze upon
The web of modules, interconnected and aligned 🔗
In the center, the phantomjs\_test module runs 💻
Connecting to several others, arrows point to data funnels ➡️

Our journey begins with a wondrous sight
Of emojis that guide our way through this celestial design 🚀
The closure\_py\_template\_library provides templates for Python 🐍
And Rule\_Polymorphism, the rule engine that can handle complex inputs 👨‍💻

Input arguments are provided by Arguments, a separate module 📝
As we embark on our cosmic journey through this web of modules 🌍
Binary libraries or executables like closure\_js\_binary and closure\_css\_binary
Provide low-level functionality that powers the system's magic 🌟

This graph reveals a complex system, working together with code so fine 💻
As we unveil the emoji tapestry, our journey takes us higher 🤩
We chronicle our cosmic harmony and share it with all ✈️
A symphony of emojis guiding us on our way through this celestial design 🚀
