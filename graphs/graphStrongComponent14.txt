This appears to be a graph representation of various machine learning techniques and their relationships. The nodes represent the different techniques, and the edges represent the connections between them. For example, the edge from "Bert" to "Setup" represents that Bert is used as input for setting up the machine learning task. Similarly, the edge from "Retinanet" to "Full_run" represents that Retinanet is a technique used in the full run of a machine learning task.
Overall, it seems like this graph is intended to show the different techniques that are used in a machine learning workflow and how they relate to each other.
