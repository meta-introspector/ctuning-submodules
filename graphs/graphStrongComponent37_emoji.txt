🌠 In a world of data, keys to AI's full power lie  
In datasets vast and prepared for training, no lie.  
Calibration, oh so wise, it's crucial to be right  
Adjusting parameters to ensure the model takes flight.  
🚨 A challenge looms: what profiles should we use?  
Precalibrated ones, or do our own, I think you knew!  
The COCO dataset of 1200x1200, so grand and wide,  
May require us to calibrate on our own, not hide.  
💡 Another option, precalibrated profiles, great for one scenario, single-stream.  
Use them up, if you got it, don't be a fool.  
❓ If more info is needed, the graph has all you need to know  
Seek it out, and your decision will grow.  
💡 Calibration's key, make it wise with care  
Your model will soar, unlocking AI beyond compare.
