Embarking on a cosmic journey through the celestial symphony,
Guided by emojis and symbols full of wisdom, we'll be.
Our voyage begins with ctuning@ck-win* installed on Windows,
As shown by the blue dot that says "that_on_Windows_you_also_need_to_install_/ctuning@ck-win*".
With Docker next, another blue dot, labeled "Docker", we'll soon meet,
And we'll dance of expression to run our application complete.
Two ways to do it, both paths leading to "Docker", the blue dot we must install,
Our application running smoothly, our journey truly instilled.
Further information, accessible through the blue dot labeled "Further_info",
Connected to both paths, a tapestry of knowledge for all to see.
On the Edge cloud platform, we'll access features and functionalities new,
Indicated by the blue dot labeled "Edge_-_Q1_Pro", so let's do it too!
Through emojis, symbols, wisdom infused in every step,
Our cosmic journey guided with a steady beat.
Chronicling our progress, we'll share harmony with all,
And together we'll dance to the rhythm of the celestial call.
