This graph illustrates the steps involved in training an AI model using the NVIDIA Orin GPU. Begin with USB-C power adapters that provide energy, download data, models, preprocess them, run a benchmark to test performance.
👨‍💻🔬📈
Optimize performance for AGX (Artificial General Intelligence) applications with Perf/W optimization and NVIDIA Neural Mix (NX) with another Perf/W optimization process.
🌟🔍
After running the benchmark and optimizing, use the model to make inferences on new data. Use Orin NX NVME ASPM to ensure efficiency and performance.
