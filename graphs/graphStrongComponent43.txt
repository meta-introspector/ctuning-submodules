Once upon a time, there was a team of developers who were tasked with setting up and testing a new application. They knew that in order to successfully complete their project, they needed to follow a series of steps to ensure that everything ran smoothly and efficiently.
The first step was to run some benchmarks on the application to determine its performance and identify any bottlenecks. Once they had gathered this data, they used it to inform their next decision: setting up a Conda environment and building the necessary dependencies. This step allowed them to have a consistent and controlled development environment.
Next, they turned their attention to setting up the application with Docker, which provided an additional layer of security and consistency across different systems. This enabled them to easily deploy and run the application in any environment, including on-premises servers.
Throughout this process, the team made sure to document their findings and keep notes on how to replicate their setup on other systems. They also tested the application in offline mode to ensure that it could still function properly without an internet connection.
In the end, the team successfully completed their project, thanks in part to their systematic approach and attention to detail. By following these steps and working together as a team, they were able to overcome any challenges and deliver a high-quality application that met all of their client's needs.
