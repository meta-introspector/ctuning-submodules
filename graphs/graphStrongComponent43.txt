The flowchart depicts a process that involves setting up Docker, creating a Conda environment, running benchmarks, and noting the scenario on the server. The process starts with running a command for the server and offline mode, followed by setting up with Docker, and then creating a Conda environment and building dependencies. After that, the benchmark is run, and finally, the scenario is noted on the server.

The nodes in the flowchart are labeled with their respective steps, and each node has a unique color and ID. The edges connect the nodes in the order they occur in the process. For example, the edge from "4._Run_command_for_server_and_offline_mode" to "Setup_with_Docker" indicates that after running the command for the server and offline mode, setting up with Docker is the next step.

Overall, this flowchart provides a clear visual representation of the process involved in deploying a machine learning model on a server, which can be helpful for understanding the workflow and identifying potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
