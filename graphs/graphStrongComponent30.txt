The graph presented here is a flowchart that illustrates the process of troubleshooting and optimizing performance for AGX/NX systems. The journey begins with the application of perf optimization, which helps to improve the overall performance of the system. However, if issues are encountered during this process, it may be necessary to troubleshoot the system to identify and resolve any problems.
To begin troubleshooting, one can flash the board, which involves updating the firmware on the device. This can help to resolve any software-related issues that may be causing performance problems. Alternatively, one can use ZenML server with docker-compose, which is a powerful tool for machine learning and data processing.
Once the system has been optimized and any issues have been resolved, it is important to continue monitoring its performance to ensure that it remains stable and efficient. This may involve applying additional perf optimization techniques or making adjustments to the system configuration as needed.
Overall, the process of troubleshooting and optimizing performance for AGX/NX systems requires a combination of technical expertise, creativity, and courage. By following the steps outlined in this flowchart and staying vigilant, users can ensure that their systems run smoothly and efficiently, even under heavy workloads.
