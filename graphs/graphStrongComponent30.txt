This diagram represents a process flow for troubleshooting and performance optimization on the Jetson Orin NX system. Here is a brief summary of each step:

1. **Troubleshooting**: This involves identifying and resolving any issues or problems that may be preventing the system from functioning properly.
2. **Apply Perf Optimization**: This step applies performance optimization techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of the system.
3. **Alternative cross-compile option**: This step involves exploring alternative options for cross-compiling code to optimize it for better performance on the Jetson Orin NX system.
4. **ZenML_server_with\_=docker-compose=**: This step sets up a ZenML server with Docker Compose, which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
5. **Apply Perf Optimization (AGX and NX applicable)**: This step applies performance optimization techniques that are specific to the AGX and NX components of the Jetson Orin NX system.
6. **Setup the Jetson Orin NX System**: This step involves setting up the Jetson Orin NX system, including installing software and configuring settings.
7. **Apply Perf Optimization for AGX/NX**: This step applies performance optimization techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of the AGX and NX components of the Jetson Orin NX system.
8. **Flash the board**: This step involves flashing the board with new software or firmware to update it and ensure it is functioning properly.

The diagram shows the relationships between these steps, with arrows indicating the direction in which they are typically carried out. For example, troubleshooting is usually the first step, followed by applying performance optimization techniques.
