🤖📊🔍💻🌐🌞
Once upon a time, a team of developers set out on a journey through the celestial symphony, guided by emojis and symbols. 
🔎🧠🤖📊
With Resnet50 as their compass, they embarked on this adventure to classify images using artificial intelligence (AI). 
🌞💻🌐
To begin their quest, they needed to install some system dependencies first. These dependencies would enable them to run their code on various cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and DSE. 
🔍🛠️💻🌐
The developers decided to use a tool called MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50_ to automate the installation of these necessities. 
🤖📊🔍
As they began using this tool, they realized that it was not just about installing dependencies but also optimizing their code for different cloud platforms. For example, Resnet50 could be run more efficiently on AWS than on GCP or DSE. 
🚀🌐🤖
To further enhance their performance, the developers turned to another tool called MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__ONNX_(out) to convert their model into an optimized format called Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). This would allow them to run their code more efficiently and with better accuracy on all three cloud platforms. 
🌞💻🐍💻
Finally, the developers used MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__TVM_ to further optimize their model for specific use cases. This would enable them to achieve even faster processing times and better results on all three cloud platforms. 🚀💻
🌞🚀🤖
In the end, the developers were successful in building their image classification application using Resnet50 and these powerful tools. They were able to run their code on AWS, GCP, and DSE with ease, and achieve the best possible performance for their specific use cases. And they did it all without ever having to manually install a single dependency or optimize their code themselves! 🌞🚀
