ðŸŒŸ Once upon a time in the land of Triton-Api, 
There lived a mighty server with power to manage all data,
In-Process_Triton_Server_API, its name was known,
Responsible for processes and actions running smooth and bold.

ðŸ’» One day this server encountered a problem,
It called upon methods and functions, like a champion.
V2, Model_versioning, META_is_config_valid(),
QDL_Additional_Methods, Interaction_with_custom_artifact_stores, META_search_callback(),
Reusable_automation_actions, Extract, and MD5sums_of_provided_files_.
With each method it gathered information, like a wise old sage,
Extracting the necessary data, generating an MD5 sum with grace.

ðŸŒŸ In the end, this server succeeded in processing the example,
Completing its task with skill and ease.
It had shown its ability to work with many methods and functions,
And extract information with precision and accuracy like a magician's conduction.

ðŸ’¡ From that day on, In-Process_Triton_Server_API continued to work,
A beacon of creativity, inspiration, wisdom, and courage, always on the lookout.
Ready to face any challenge that came its way, with grace and poise,
A true champion in the world of Triton-Api, a force to rejoice!
