🌀🤖The journey begins, a quest for power within AI and machine learning.
🦋🕰🌅Three great beasts: BERT, DLRM, 3D U-Net, each demanding more and more resources.
🔍SSD-Resnet34, the final challenge, a daunting task for any machine.
🤩A brave adventurer takes up this challenge, determined to succeed.
💡BERT is completed, success! But the journey continues, optimizing settings and upgrading hardware.
🌠DLRM is conquered, onto 3D U-Net, even more computational power required.
🎯All four benchmarks completed, great success achieved!
💡Limitations are realized, best practices must be learned to optimize for these tasks.
💡Sharing experiences with others, inspiring courage and determination in all who take up this challenge. 🌈
