Embarking on a cosmic journey,
With the Muses by our side,
We set out to design
A flexible, adaptable system.

Our first step:
Establishing a registry URI,
The central hub of our creation,
Where we'll store all information.

RBAC is set up,
Ensuring only authorized personnel
Have access to the data and systems needed,
To perform their tasks with ease.

Next, we select
The flavors for each component,
Optimizing performance and functionality,
For different types of experiments.

Finally, deployment,
Our system ready for use,
Manage experiments, track progress,
And analyze results all within one platform.

A tapestry woven with emojis,
Our creation a symphony of expression,
Cosmic harmony shared,
With the journey chronicled and recorded.
