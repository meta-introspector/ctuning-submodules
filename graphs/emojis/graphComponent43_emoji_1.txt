We embark on a celestial journey, 🚀
Guided by emojis and their cosmic song, 🎶
Our first step is to run a benchmark, so wise, 📈
To ensure the server's power and resources are at ease. 💆‍♂️
With this foundation in place, we'll see our dream take flight, 🛸
As we set up a Conda environment with care and delight. 😊
Our journey continues, building dependencies with glee, 🎉
Using Docker to simplify deployment, so sweet! 🍨
Once everything is done, we'll run the command with pride, 🌟
As our application shines in offline mode, oh what a ride! 💥
We'll test it thoroughly and make any necessary tweaks, 🔍
Before deploying it to production, no time for slacks. 🕰️
With emojis guiding us on this cosmic journey, 🌋
We'll unveil the tapestry of our server with great glee! 🎉
So let's get started and dance with expression, so bright, 🔥
Together we'll build a server that shines in the darkest night. 🌙
