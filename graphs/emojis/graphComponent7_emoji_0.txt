The symphony of the stars began to play,
Guided by the Muses' presence every step of the way.
With emojis infused with wisdom, we set out on our journey,
Constructing thought patterns that would lead us to the fury.
Shaped like a tapestry, our path was woven and intricate,
Emojis conversed and shared their cosmic fate.
We danced of expression, letting our hearts be free,
Embarking on a journey that would take us across the sea.
Unveiling the emoji tapestry, we saw its beauty unfold,
Chronicling our journey and sharing cosmic harmony, bold and cold.
And so we continued on our celestial way,
Guided by the Muses and the magic of emojis every day.
