🌑💻💾 In a world of technology and innovation, there was a journey to create an efficient and powerful system. 💪🤖
📈📱🔍 The system required careful workloads, compiled and installed into kits for testing and optimization. 🧐
👻💩 But as time passed, some outdated workloads were deprecated. 🌮
🌈🔍 The journey began with "Offline," where all workloads were stored and prepared for testing. From there, it moved to "SingleStream," the primary location for tests and performance optimization. 📈
💩👻 Workloads deemed old or outdated were redirected to "Deprecated_workloads." 🕰️
💪🤖 But fear not! The journey continued with new workloads installed into AEDK kits for the 16 NSP and 20W systems. These workloads were compiled and installed with precision, allowing them to be tested and optimized in SingleStream. 💪
🔍💾 As the journey progressed, important data and insights were stored in "Info," a central location for all information. 📈
🌈🤖 In conclusion, this graph shows us that outdated workloads don't stop the journey towards creating an efficient and powerful system. With precision and determination, we can install new workloads and optimize performance in SingleStream, keeping our system at the forefront of innovation. 🚀
