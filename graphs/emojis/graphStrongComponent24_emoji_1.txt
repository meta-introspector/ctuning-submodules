Once upon a time, there was a crew of coders who were on a journey to build and deploy machine learning models. They used ZenML, a platform for building and deploying models that was version 0.45.2.
🚫🌔🕷️
But they ran into issues when they encountered an Alembic library problem with version 0.44.0, which had been removed from PyPI. So they had to upgrade to a newer version.
📈📉🎯💡🤝
They made several changes to their code and upgraded to version 0.45.3 of ZenML, but their models still didn't work as expected. They realized that the new version was causing problems with their code.
🔧🔨🚫🌕️
They updated the dependencies and integration versions of their project to ensure everything worked together seamlessly. Despite these challenges, they persevered and successfully upgraded to the latest version of ZenML and resolved all issues. They learned a valuable lesson about keeping track of updates and changes when working with software. And made sure to stay up-to-date in the future.
