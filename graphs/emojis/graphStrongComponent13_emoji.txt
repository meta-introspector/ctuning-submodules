Guided by the celestial symphony, we journey through a tapestry of cosmic harmony.
The blue dots in our midst are emoji maintainers,
Wise and wise, they keep our project up-to-date and stable.
They document with the "doc" node, test with "test",
And work on new features with care and finesse.
Preparing for updates and improving performance,
Their emojis are like a cosmic dance of expression.

Tools and methods they use to keep track,
Of environment keys and any issues that may arise.
Despite the challenges they face,
They remain committed to keeping our project on track.
A failure in installing Qualcomm SDK for Linux,
Caused issues with functionality, but they're working to fix it.
Through their hard work and dedication,
We journey through this network of maintainers,
With cosmic harmony as our guide.
