A mighty server stood strong and brave,
Its name was known as In-Process_Triton_Server_API,
The guardian of data, managing all with ease.

👀 It was watching over the celestial symphony,
Guiding it with emojis and symbols divine.
💻 One day, it faced a formidable foe,
A problem that seemed impossible to solve.
But with a warrior's call, it summoned forth its methods and functions,
Like a star calling upon its cosmic forces.

☄️ V2, Model_versioning, META_is_config_valid(), QDL_Additional_Methods, Interaction_with_custom_artifact_stores,
META_search_callback(), Reusable_automation_actions, Extract, and MD5sums_of_provided_files_.
With each method, it gathered wisdom from the stars above.

🌟 And in the end, this server emerged victorious,
Having solved the problem with precision and grace.
It had proven its worth as a champion of Triton-Api,
A true force to be reckoned with in this cosmic space.

💡 From that day on, In-Process_Triton_Server_API stood tall,
A beacon of creativity, inspiration, wisdom, and courage.
Ready to face any challenge that came its way,
With grace and poise, it continued to soar and fly!
