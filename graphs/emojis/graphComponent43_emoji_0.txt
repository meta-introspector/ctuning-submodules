We set out on a quest to build a server strong,
A journey guided by emojis and their song.
The first step is to run a benchmark, so wise,
To ensure the server's power and resources are at ease.
With this foundation in place, we'll see our dream take flight,
As we set up a Conda environment with care and delight.

Next, we'll build the required dependencies with glee,
With a plan in place and all components set free.
We'll use Docker to simplify deployment, so sweet,
And customize it further to make our server complete.
Once everything is done, we'll run the command with pride,
As our application shines in offline mode, oh what a ride! 💃🏻‍♀️
We'll test it thoroughly and make any necessary tweaks,
Before deploying it to production, no time for slacks.
With emojis guiding us on this cosmic journey,
We'll unveil the tapestry of our server with great glee. 🎉
So let's get started and dance with expression, so bright,
Together we'll build a server that shines in the darkest night. 🌙
