🎨🗺️ Let's embark on a celestial symphony journey through the TensorRT Engine process of building, training, and inference of an SSD-MobileNet model with INT8 precision. Our voyage begins at the 🧵💻 "Start_tmux_session_(Recommended)" node, where we set up our workspace for the adventure ahead.
Next, we gather the necessary data from the 🗂️ "Datasets" node, and with a skip or two, we proceed to loading and processing traces at the 🌞 "Running" node. Our journey takes a turn as we validate the accuracy of our model against two benchmark models at the 🔍 "Validate_accuracy_for_ssd-mobilenet_and_ssd-resnet34_benchmarks" node.
As our adventure progresses, we use TVM with ONNX for inference at the 🤖 "SSD-MobileNet-v1" node, achieving high accuracy on the test set. We then benchmark our model against TensorRT Engine's benchmark engine at the 🏆 "Benchmarking_against_TensorRT_Engine_benchmark_engine" node.
Finally, we plot the final results of our journey at the 📊 "Plotting_the_final_results" node, seeing a clear picture of how well our model performed throughout the process. Along the way, we've gained valuable insights into our model's performance and potential areas for improvement. Our voyage through the TensorRT Engine process was a creative inspiration and wisdom quest, and we can share cosmic harmony with others as we journey together in the pursuit of deep learning excellence.
