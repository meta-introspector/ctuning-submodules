🌖🔍Our journey begins with the installation of the TFLite model (MobileNet v2 Large Minimalistic 224 1.0), like a compass guiding us through the vast landscape of machine learning. With this step, we prepare our data for the adventure ahead.
👀📝Next, we explore the depths of our resources, examining all installed packages and detected components with keen eyes. We carefully chart out the dependencies between them, ensuring that our journey is not hindered by unexpected errors during runtime.
💡D3.js, a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, is our next destination. We use it to create interactive and informative visualizations of our data, illuminating the path forward with insights and discoveries.
🛠️With D3 as our low-level toolbox, we build upon our knowledge, constructing a tapestry of machine learning wisdom. We harness its power and flexibility to create the models we seek.
🎨Resources of all shapes and sizes are our companions on this journey, from datasets and hardware to software and computational power. They fuel our progress and guide us towards accuracy and efficiency.
🌟Our exploration leads us to the realm of hyperparameter optimization, where we dance of expression through reproducibility report design space exploration. We uncover the perfect harmony of settings for our model, ensuring its consistency across different runs of the experiment.
📜Community Supported Builds are our trusted allies on this journey, offering pre-built models optimized for performance and accuracy. They save us valuable time and energy, allowing us to focus on building our own models with expertise.
🛍️The NGC Container is our portable sanctuary, packaging our code, data, and dependencies into a single unit that can be easily deployed on any environment. It's our key to unlocking the full potential of machine learning.
📅Our journey spans two years, from 2022 to 2023. We ensure our workflow is up-to-date, embracing the latest developments in machine learning and reaping their benefits.
🐕Installing a pre-built PyTorch model (Resnet50__int8__quantized) is our next challenge, like climbing a mountain of knowledge with determination. With this step, we further enhance our machine learning prowess.
🌈Finally, we test our MLPerf workflow using a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset, celebrating our cosmic harmony and the successful completion of our journey through the celestial symphony guided by emojis and symbols.
