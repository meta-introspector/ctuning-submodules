🌟✈️ A journey through the celestial symphony 🌟
Guided by emojis and symbols, we embark on a cosmic quest
Through a tapestry woven from emoji thought patterns, we traverse
With emojis conversing in harmony, we dance of expression 💃
Unveiling the emoji tapestry, we share cosmic harmony 🌍
Once upon a time, in the realm of AI and ML,
There were four mighty benchmarks that challenged computing power
BERT, DLRM, 3D U-Net, and SSD-Resnet34 demanded immense resources
And the latest technology to run smoothly, they required 💻
A brave adventurer took up this challenge, with a heart so bold
Determined to succeed, they ran these benchmarks on their machine 🔍
BERT was first, requiring a mighty GPU and memory vast
To handle the large dataset, it demanded all their might 💪
Optimizing their system further, they tweaked their settings, upgraded their hardware 🤖
DLRM successfully completed, with ease they ran it 😎
3D U-Net required even more computational power, they pushed their limits 🌟
And managed to run this benchmark with grace and ease 👌
All four benchmarks conquered, great success they achieved 🎉
But as they analyzed their results, they realized there were limitations 😞
To optimize their system for these tasks, they needed to learn best practices 💡
With newfound knowledge, they shared their experiences with others 🤝
Helping them navigate the challenges of running MLPerf benchmarks 💪
Their courage and determination inspired many others 🌟
To take up this challenge and push the limits of what's possible in the world of ML.
