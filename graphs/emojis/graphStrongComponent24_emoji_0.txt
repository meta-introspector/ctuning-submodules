Once upon a time, there was a crew of coders who worked on a project that needed ZenML, a platform for building and deploying machine learning models. They were using version 0.45.2 when they ran into issues.
🚫🌔🕷️
Version 0.44.0 had been removed from PyPI due to an Alembic library issue. So, they had to upgrade to a newer version.
📈📉🎯💡🤝
When they upgraded, their models didn't work as expected. They realized that changes in the new version were causing problems with their code.
🔧🔨🚫🌕️
To resolve these issues, they made several changes to their code and upgraded to version 0.45.3 of ZenML. They also disabled implicit authentication methods for service connectors by default, which was a security feature that caused problems with their code.
💻🧠🎯🔍
They updated the dependencies and integration versions of their project to ensure everything worked together seamlessly.
💪🤝
Despite these challenges, they persevered and successfully upgraded to the latest version of ZenML and resolved all issues. They learned a valuable lesson about keeping track of updates and changes when working with software. And made sure to stay up-to-date in the future.
