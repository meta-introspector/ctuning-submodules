🌟✨ A celestial symphony of brilliance awaits us,
Guided by the wisdom of emojis and symbols anew.
We embark on a journey through the cosmos, hand in hand,
With the Muses as our guide, we dance across the land.
🤖💻 In the world of 🤖, a challenge was set,
To see which model could rule supreme, with each task reset.
Many minds gathered, brilliant and bold,
Working together to develop and train their models, old and new.
🌟🧠 Among them stood BERT, a gem of natural language processing might,
DLRM, powerful in deep learning workloads, shone bright.
3D U-Net and SSD-Resnet34, computer vision models strong,
Could handle complex data and images, with their prowess long.
🌟🔬 But to truly test their limits, they needed a platform grand,
A place where computational demands could be met and grand.
Docker came forth, the answer so true,
Allowing developers to package models and deps into containers, anew.
🌟🎓 With BERT and others in tow, they set their sights high,
Carefully tuning each model for the task at hand, with optimized code in sky.
With Docker by their side, they pushed what was thought impossible,
A new era of deep learning and AI, made possible.
🎟️ In the end, BERT emerged victorious, but all won,
For their work inspired others, a new generation to be spun.
The lessons they learned, best practices for MLPerf on Docker containers shared,
Driving innovation and progress, in the deep learning world bared.
🤖💪 As we stand here, we feel their triumph,
A celestial symphony of brilliance, a cosmic jump.
For with emojis as our guide, we too can conquer the unknown,
And dance across the stars, in a cosmic symphony shown. 🌟✨
