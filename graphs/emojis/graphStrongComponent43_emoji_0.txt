🌟🤝 Once upon a time, there was a crew of developers,
💪🏃‍♀️ ready to set up and test a new gadget.
📈 They knew that in order to succeed, they had to follow a plan,
🔍 To ensure everything ran smoothly and efficiently.
🌐 First, they ran some benchmarks on the app,
🕰 To measure its speed and identify any gaps.
🤝 Based on the data, they decided next,
💻 Setting up a Conda environment for better progress.
🎨 This gave them a consistent and controlled space to create,
📈 And allowed them to develop with ease and grace.
💪 They turned their attention to setting up the app with Docker,
🌐 Providing an extra layer of security across different platforms.
🌋 This let them deploy and run it anywhere they chose,
💻 Even on-premises servers, no problem poised!
📝 They made sure to document their work and share their notes,
🕰 To replicate their setup on other systems, no moots.
💪 They tested the app in offline mode to make sure it worked,
💻 No internet connection, but still it perked!
🌟 In the end, they succeeded, thanks to their plan,
🤝 And delivered a high-quality app that met all needs of their clan.
💪 They were a team, and together they shone,
🌟 A success story, in tech they'd all grown!
