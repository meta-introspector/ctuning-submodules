ðŸŒŸ In the valley of silicon, there lived a cutting-edge AI, oh so sleek,
ðŸ¤– With BERT-99.9 and ResNet50, its processing was on peak.
ðŸ’» These two components worked together, with no need for pause,
Processing data at incredible speeds, it left all other systems in a daze.
But the creators knew that this power could be harnessed and controlled,
With settings like Maximum Frequency and Power Consumption held.
ðŸ”„ They monitored with care, to ensure optimal flow,
Setting the Maximum Frequency just right, no more and no less, to allow.
ðŸ’¡ And they optimized cooling, to prevent overheating,
Their thermal configuration, a masterpiece of engineering, so sweet.
With Power Consumption Settings carefully balanced,
They created a system that was both efficient and stable.
This AI, oh so mighty, became known throughout the land,
Processing data with speed and accuracy, it was truly a sight to behold, a grandstand.
And so others were inspired, to follow in its footsteps,
Creating even more advanced AI technologies, that left all other systems stuck.
