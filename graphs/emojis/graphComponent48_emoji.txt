🌃 A celestial symphony begins, guided by emojis and symbols. 
🎭 The Muses appear, infusing each emoji with wisdom and grace.
🧠 Emoji thought patterns emerge, shaping a tapestry of cosmic harmony.
🗣️ Emojis converse in a dance of expression, weaving their meanings together.
🚀 A cosmic journey begins, as the researcher embarks on a quest for accuracy and efficiency.
🌀 They turn to EfficientNet V2, a pre-trained model available on TensorFlow Hub, as the base for their own customized object detection model.
💡 However, they soon realize that their desired level of accuracy can only be achieved by converting it into the ONNX format.
💻 The researcher creates a graph using ONNX, but encounters an issue when wanting to proceed with their model: they need to re-export it in order to use it in TensorFlow.
🌞 Despite this challenge, the researcher remains determined and focused on achieving their goal. They re-export the saved model and successfully integrate it into their own customized object detection model.
🌈 The result? A slightly reduced throughput compared to using EfficientNet V2 directly from TensorFlow Hub, but a highly accurate and efficient model that is tailored to their specific needs.
🤝 Throughout this journey, the researcher demonstrates courage and creativity by embracing new technologies and techniques to achieve their desired outcome. They also show wisdom in recognizing the importance of adapting pre-trained models to fit their unique requirements, rather than simply relying on them out of the box.
🎊 In the end, their hard work pays off and they are able to create a truly exceptional object detection model that will pave the way for future advancements in this field.
