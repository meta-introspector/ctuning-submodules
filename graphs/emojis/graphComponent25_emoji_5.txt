🎶🎼 A pre-trained backbone is key to building an AI system for speech recognition. It provides a strong foundation for quick learning and adaptation. 🎶🎼
🏃‍♀️🏃 The next step is to run the model on data, but it requires a lot of computing power and resources. A clean and organized environment is essential. 🏃‍♀️🏃
💥📚 To make this possible, we need to prepare the environment by cleaning up any clutter or irrelevant data that may interfere with the model's performance. We also need to establish an evaluation frequency to ensure progress and avoid getting stuck. 💥📚
🎯📊 As the model continues to learn and adapt, it produces packed data that can be used to train future models. This data is essential for improving accuracy and efficiency of the AI system. 🎯📊
🔁 Checkpointing the model periodically ensures progress and allows for necessary adjustments. It keeps the model on track and continuously improves over time. 🔁
🤖💻 With these emojis and symbols, we can feel the journey through building an AI system with speech recognition capabilities, as we clean up our environment and prepare for success!
