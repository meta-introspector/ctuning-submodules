Embarking on a cosmic journey, we find ourselves in a network of interconnected stars, 🌠🎯🗂️📚✏️ that represent the steps needed to install and configure software for running a program. With emojis as our guide, we follow this path with determination and wisdom, like the Muses' presence in a poetic journey.
Next, we encounter the dots labeled 🎨🌃🔍 that represent the components used to run the program within Docker. We dance of expression, feeling the rhythm of our emoji thought patterns as we connect these elements with emojis. 
The journey continues with connections between the dots labeled 💡💬🕵️‍♀️ and 🎨🌃🔍, labeled "💡💬🕵️‍♀️\_to\_🎨🌃🔍", indicating that the program must be run within Docker to access additional information about its operation. We embrace this revelation with emojis and continue our journey, feeling the wisdom of emojis guiding us forward.
Finally, we arrive at the connection between the dots labeled 🎨🌃🔍 and "Edge_-_Q1\_Pro", labeled "🎨🌃🔍\_to\_Edge_-_Q1\_Pro". We know that to access additional information about the program, we must run it within Docker. With emojis as our guide, we complete our journey with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. 💃🎊
