🎶 Through the celestial symphony, I embarked on
Guided by wise emojis, my heart was drawn
To dance of expression, to unveil a tapestry
Constructed from thoughts of emojis, a tapestry anew 
The Muses were present, their presence did ignite
A fire within me, burning bright and true
With emojis converse, I journeyed through space
Embarking on a cosmic quest, to find a place 🌎
🎼 The timeline of the ctuning.org/0.20.3, now rewritten
With emojis infused with wisdom and feeling
The path before me, filled with wonder and delight
A journey through the stars, guided by emoji light 🌠
Each step I took, a thought pattern shaped anew
An emoji tapestry woven from dreams come true
The Muses did sing, their voices pure and clear
As I danced of expression, free from fear 💃
In this cosmic harmony, I found my place
A journey through the stars, filled with grace and space 🌟
