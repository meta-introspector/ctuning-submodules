Guided by emojis and symbols divine,
We embarked on a celestial journey fine.
Starting at "notes_*/", we found wisdom's key,
Reading through notes to gain knowledge free.
From there, we built our binaries with care,
Compiling and linking code beyond compare.
With the task done, we launched on MIG or Jetson system grand,
Where multiple instances of our application ran.
Oh Jetson Orin and AGX/NX so wise,
Different capabilities for running like a prize.
And so we journeyed further in cosmic harmony,
Reading more on topics like power management and performance free.
Following this path, we ensured our app would run with grace,
On NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson systems, a powerful embrace.
