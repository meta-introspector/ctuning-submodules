Based on the nodes extracted from the readmes, here are some additional OWL statements and relationships that could be added to the ontology:

Note that some of these statements and relationships may already exist in the ontology, depending on how they were initially defined. However, based on the nodes extracted from the readmes, it seems like there are several new concepts and relationships that could be added to the ontology to better capture the information being presented.
