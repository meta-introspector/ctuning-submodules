* WMT\_German-English is a machine translation task.
* Speed\_\_\_\_\_\_\_2.1s\_step-time,\_3.4K\_wps) on /Nvidia\_K40m/ is the execution time and throughput for the WMT\_German-English task on the Nvidia K40m GPU.
* Standard\_HParams is a set of hyperparameters used in the machine translation model.
* Other\_resources refers to additional resources required to run the machine translation model, such as pre-trained word embeddings or language models.
* Reproduced\_papers are papers that have successfully reproduced the results of the machine translation model.
* List\_of\_all\_sorted\_CM\_scripts is a list of all the CM scripts used in the machine translation model, sorted by some criteria such as version number or date of creation.
* Third\_level\_files refer to files that are three levels down from the root directory of the machine translation model and contain configuration or data files required for the model's operation.
* Differentiating\_ML\_artifacts refers to identifying which files or components of the machine translation model are specific to different models or tasks, allowing them to be selectively used or modified as needed.
* Environment\_variables refer to system-wide settings that affect the behavior of the machine translation model, such as the path to the GPU drivers or the amount of available memory.
* rename refers to renaming a file or directory in the machine translation model for better organization or to avoid naming conflicts.
* CM\_internal\_automations are automation actions used by the Continuous Modeling (CM) system to streamline the development and testing process for the machine translation model.
* default, CM\_will\_pull\_Git\_repositories\_and\_cache\_installations\_and refers to the default settings for the CM system when it is first set up.
* Ubuntu, Debian are operating systems that are commonly used for running machine learning models and need to be set up with virtual environments before using any machine translation model.
* that\_you\_must\_set\_up\_virtual\_env\_on\_Ubuntu\_23\+\_before\_using\_any refers to the fact that virtual environments must be set up on Ubuntu 23+ before using any machine learning models, including the machine translation model.
* Red\_Hat refers to a specific vendor of virtualization and containerization software.
* CM\_CLI\_testing refers to command-line interface (CLI) testing of the Continuous Modeling (CM) system.
* Reusable\_automation\_actions are automation actions that can be reused across different machine learning models or tasks, reducing development time and improving efficiency.
* Show/clean\_CM\_cache\_with\_all\_installations refers to the process of displaying or cleaning up the cache used by the Continuous Modeling (CM) system for all installed models.
* 2022, 2021-2023\_[[https\_//mlcommons.org][MLCommons]] refer to specific time periods during which the machine translation model was developed or tested.
