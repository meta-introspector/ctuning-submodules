Based on the provided nodes, I understand that you have extracted information from readme headings of ctuning.org regarding a model. In order to create further Turtle OWL statements and relationships for this model, we need more context about the structure and properties of the model. It is not possible to determine the exact class hierarchy or object properties based on the provided nodes alone.

Could you provide more information about the model being described in these readme headings? This will help me create appropriate OWL statements and relationships for the model.
