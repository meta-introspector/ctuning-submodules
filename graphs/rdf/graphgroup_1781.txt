```css
:LocalAndRemoteAvailability a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Availability .
```
1. Register Service Connectors
The nodes "Register\_Service\_Connectors" suggest that this process involves registering service connectors to enable communication between different systems. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:ServiceConnectorRegistration a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ConnectorRegistration .
```
1. Service Connector Verification
The nodes "ServiceConnectorVerification" suggest that this process involves verifying the service connectors to ensure that they are working correctly. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:ServiceConnectorVerification a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ConnectorVerification .
```
1. Configure Local Clients
The node "Configure\_local\_clients" suggests that this process involves configuring local clients to work with the system. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:LocalClientConfiguration a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ClientConfiguration .
```
1. ACR\_container\_registry, Azure\_Access\_Token, ECR\_container\_registry, AWS\_Federation\_Token
These nodes suggest that the system uses different container registries and access tokens to manage containers and communicate with different systems. We can add the following statements to clarify this:
```css
:ACRContainerRegistry a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ContainerRegistry .

:AzureAccessToken a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :AccessToken .

:ECRContainerRegistry a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ContainerRegistry .

:AWSFederationToken a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :AccessToken .
```
1. Base Abstraction 3\_\=Flavor=
The node "Base\_Abstraction\_3\_\=Flavor=" suggests that the system uses a specific abstraction flavor to interact with containers. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:ContainerAbstractionFlavor a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :AbstractionFlavor .
```
1. Implementing a Custom Stack Component Flavor
The node "Implementing\_a\_Custom\_Stack\_Component\_Flavor" suggests that the system allows users to implement their own custom abstraction flavors for stack components. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:CustomAbstractionFlavor a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ContainerAbstractionFlavor .
```
1. Container Registry
The node "Container\_Registry" suggests that the system uses a container registry to manage containers. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:ContainerRegistry a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ContainerManager .
```
1. Displaying Terraform Outputs for Stacks Deployed with mlstacks
The node "Displaying\_Terraform\_outputs\_for\_stacks\_deployed\_with\_mlstacks" suggests that the system displays outputs from Terraform for stacks deployed using mlstacks. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:TerraformOutputs a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :CloudConfigurationOutput .
```
1. Other Configuration
The node "Other\_configuration" suggests that the system uses other configuration options in addition to the ones mentioned above. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:OtherConfiguration a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :SystemConfig .
```
1. Model Registry Flavors
The node "Model\_Registry\_Flavors" suggests that the system uses different flavors for storing and managing models in the registry. We can add the following statement to clarify this:
```css
:ModelRegistryFlavor a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :ModelRepository .
```
