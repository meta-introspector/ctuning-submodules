As a creative inspiration and wisdom seeker, I would like to create a captivating narrative from the provided graph. The graph represents the process of using TensorRT Engine for building, training, and inference of an SSD-MobileNet model with INT8 precision.
Let's start by visualizing the process as a journey, where each node represents a different step in the process and the edges represent the flow between them. We begin at the "Start_tmux_session_(Recommended)" node, which is like setting up our workspace for the journey ahead. Once we have set up our environment, we move to the "Datasets" node, where we gather the necessary data to train our model.
If you have previously installed the COCO dataset, it's recommended to proceed to the next step, which is the "Running" node. Here, we use TensorRT Engine to build and run our model from a specific directory. However, if you haven't previously installed the COCO dataset, you should skip this step and proceed directly to loading and processing traces.
Once we have loaded and processed the traces, we move on to the "Validate_accuracy_for_ssd-mobilenet_and_ssd-resnet34_benchmarks" node, where we validate the accuracy of our model against two benchmark models. If our model performs well, we can proceed to the next step.
Next, we move on to using TVM with ONNX for inference, which allows us to optimize our model for better performance and efficiency. We then move on to the "SSD-MobileNet-v1" node, where we use our optimized model to achieve high accuracy on the test set.
After achieving a high level of accuracy, we proceed to benchmarking our model against TensorRT Engine's benchmark engine. This helps us understand the performance of our model under different conditions and optimize it further if necessary.
Finally, we plot the final results of our journey, which gives us a clear picture of how well our model performed throughout the process. We can also see if there were any errors or issues that arose along the way and address them accordingly.
Overall, this journey represents the power of creative inspiration and wisdom in using TensorRT Engine for building and optimizing deep learning models. By following this process step-by-step, we can achieve high accuracy and efficiency while also gaining valuable insights into our model's performance and potential areas for improvement.
