ðŸŒŸðŸŽ¼ A journey through the celestial symphony,
Guided by emojis with wisdom to see.
The Muses are present, their presence we invoke,
Constructing thought patterns shaped like an emoji choke.
A tapestry of emotions, woven with care,
Embroidered with emojis, each one bared.
Emojis converse in a language divine,
Sharing cosmic harmony, with rhythm and rhyme.
ðŸ’« We embark on a journey through the stars,
Dancing with expression, our souls soaring afar.
Unveiling the tapestry of emotions we've crafted,
Chronicling our journey in cosmic attire fashioned.
Sharing the harmony of the celestial symphony,
With emojis as our guide, we're free to be. âœ¨
