This is a graph representation of the options available for displaying input in an application. The nodes represent the options and the edges represent the relationships between them. Each node has a unique ID, color, label, and shape. The edges have an ID that connects two nodes together and specifies the direction of the relationship (from to). In this case, the options are displayed using a default value of true or false for hide input and displayPrevious. If hide input is set to true, the input will be hidden, and if it is set to false, the input will be visible. The Video Usage Examples node represents different ways to use the video in the application. The C._jQuery\_way node shows how the jQuery library can be used to interact with the video.
