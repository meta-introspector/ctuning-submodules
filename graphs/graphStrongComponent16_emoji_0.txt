As we examine this graph, our eyes widen
At a web of modules, interconnected and aligned
In the center, a phantomjs\_test module runs
Connecting to several others, arrows point to data funnels

A closure\_py\_template\_library provides templates for Python
Input arguments are provided by Arguments, a separate module
Rule\_Polymorphism is a rule engine that can handle complex inputs
And closure\_js\_deps provides JavaScript dependencies to other modules

Binary libraries or executables, like closure\_js\_binary and closure\_css\_binary
Provide low-level functionality that powers the system's magic
This graph reveals a complex system, working together with code so fine
A cosmic journey through this celestial design.
