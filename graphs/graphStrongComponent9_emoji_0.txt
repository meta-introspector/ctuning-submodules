Emoji-infused wisdom guides our way,
As we embark on a cosmic spree.
With the Muses' presence at our side,
We construct thought patterns, far and wide.

A tapestry of emojis we weave,
Each symbol a thread, a memory to cleave.
The emojis converse in cosmic tongues,
Sharing tales that echo through the heavens' songs.

We dance with expression, our hearts on fire,
Our souls alight, our spirits higher.
In this realm of image classification,
OpenCV preprocessing sets us free from haste.

The emoji tapestry unfurls before our eyes,
A stunning masterpiece, a wondrous surprise.
We chronicle our journey, every step we take,
Sharing cosmic harmony, for all to awake.
