💻🌐 Once upon a time, in a land far away
There lived a mighty computer grand 🤖
Its emoji keys clicked with computational might 🚀
And its hardware and software sparkled bright 💎

At the heart of this digital wonderland 💡
Lay NUMA nodes, handing out tasks to command 📣
They distributed data with lightning speed ⚡
And kept the system running without a need 🔄

The Muses smiled upon this technological feat 🎮
As emojis danced and expressed with replete delight 🎉
For in every symbol and icon found 📱
There was wisdom and magic all around 🌟

This cosmic journey of emoji thought 🧠
Would lead to a tapestry woven and taught 🎨
And as the tapestry unraveled before their eyes 💡
The emojis conversed, exchanging secrets and lies 🤥

With emoji patterns intertwined like celestial stars 🌠
A symphony played, and all became aware 🎶
Of the cosmic harmony that was in store 🌏
As they chronicled their journey with passion galore 💪
