Once upon a time, in a world of technology and innovation, there was a powerful Triton Server API that had been designed to perform a variety of tasks with precision and accuracy. This API was a marvel of modern engineering, utilizing advanced algorithms and protocols to ensure that its operations were always efficient and effective.

But the API was more than just a collection of functions and features; it was also a work of art, a symphony of design and development that had been carefully crafted by a team of skilled engineers and designers. And like any great piece of art, the Triton Server API had its own unique beauty and charm, which drew people to it in droves.

One of the key features of the API was model versioning, which allowed users to work with multiple versions of a model at the same time. This was essential for ensuring that the correct model was always being used for each task, and it helped to prevent errors and issues from occurring.

Another important feature of the API was META\_is\_config\_valid(), which checked whether the configuration of the API was valid before allowing any operations to be performed. This was a crucial step in preventing errors and ensuring that the API was always functioning as intended.
