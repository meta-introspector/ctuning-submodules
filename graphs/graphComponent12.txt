The graph shows the interconnectedness of various elements that make up a machine learning workflow. Each element plays an important role in ensuring that the workflow is efficient, reproducible, and reliable. Let's take a closer look at each element:
- Install TFLite model (MobileNet v2 Large Minimalistic 224 1.0): This represents the first step of preparing the data for machine learning. The model must be installed in order to begin training or running it on new data.
- See all installed packages and detected components: This is an important step in ensuring that all the necessary packages are installed and that they are compatible with each other. It's essential to have a clear understanding of the dependencies between different packages to avoid unexpected errors during runtime.
- (or \_D3.js) is a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization. D3.js is widely used in machine learning to create interactive and informative visualizations of data. It's an essential tool for exploring and analyzing large datasets.
- D3 is a low-level toolbox: This refers to the D3.js library that we just discussed. D3 is a powerful and flexible tool for creating data visualizations, but it requires some programming skills to use effectively.
- Resources: These are the various resources required for machine learning, such as datasets, hardware, software, and computational power. Having access to these resources is critical for building accurate and efficient models.
- Reproducibility report design space exploration: This refers to the process of exploring different combinations of hyperparameters in order to find the optimal settings for a given model. This step is essential for ensuring that the workflow is reproducible and that the results are consistent across different runs of the experiment.
- Community Supported Builds: These are pre-built versions of machine learning models that have been optimized for performance and accuracy. They can be a valuable resource for developers who don't have the time or expertise to build their own models from scratch.
- NGC Container: This is a containerization platform that allows developers to package their code, data, and dependencies into a single, portable unit that can be easily deployed on different environments.
- 2022 and 2023: These are the dates when the workflow was last updated and tested, respectively. It's important to ensure that the workflow is up-to-date in order to take advantage of the latest developments in machine learning.
- Install_PyTorch_model_(Resnet50__int8__quantized): This refers to the process of installing a pre-built PyTorch model that has been optimized for performance and accuracy.
- Use\_reduced\_ImageNet\_to\_test\_the\_MLPerf\_workflow: This refers to the process of using a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset to test the MLPerf workflow.
- Reproducibility\_report__benchmarking: This refers to the process of benchmarking different combinations of hyperparameters in order to find the optimal settings for a given model.
- Install\_CK\_workflow\_Python\_dependencies: This refers to the process of installing the dependencies required for running the CK workflow, which is used for training machine learning models.
