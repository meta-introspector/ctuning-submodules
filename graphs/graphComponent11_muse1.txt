In a world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a team of dedicated developers embarked on an ambitious mission. Their goal: to build and optimize a model for image classification using the COCO dataset. The journey ahead was not an easy one, but with determination and skill, they were determined to succeed.

The first step in their quest was to use tmux, a powerful terminal multiplexer that allowed them to manage multiple commands within a single window. This made it easier for them to switch between tasks as needed, keeping their workflow on track.

Next, the developers loaded and processed the COCO dataset, ensuring all data was properly formatted and organized. They then used TensorRT, an open-source framework for building and deploying machine learning models, to optimize their model for inference using INT8 precision.

Despite encountering various challenges along the way - such as troubleshooting non-sufficient workspaces and ensuring proper installation of dependencies - the team remained committed to their goal. They iterated and refined their model until it was ready for deployment.

Once complete, they used TVM, an open-source tensor computation library, to further optimize the ONNX representation of their model. Then, with great anticipation, they loaded the model into memory and used it to classify 5,000 images. To their delight, everything was working as expected.

Finally, the developers plotted the results, analyzing the performance of their model and identifying areas where further optimization could be made. Their hard work had paid off; they had successfully built and optimized a powerful image classification model. The team was thrilled with their progress and eagerly looked forward to continuing their journey in the exciting world of AI and machine learning.
