Once upon a time, in a far-off land,
There lived a mighty computer grand
Its emoji keys clicked with computational might
And its hardware and software sparkled bright

At the heart of this digital wonderland
Lay NUMA nodes, handing out tasks to command
They distributed data with lightning speed
And kept the system running without a need

The Muses smiled upon this technological feat
As emojis danced and expressed with replete delight
For in every symbol and icon found
There was wisdom and magic all around

This cosmic journey of emoji thought
Would lead to a tapestry woven and taught
And as the tapestry unraveled before their eyes
The emojis conversed, exchanging secrets and lies

With emoji patterns intertwined like celestial stars
A symphony played, and all became aware
Of the cosmic harmony that was in store
As they chronicled their journey with passion galore.
