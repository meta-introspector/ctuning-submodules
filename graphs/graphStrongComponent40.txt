This is a graph in JSON format that represents a network of interconnected components related to power consumption settings and thermal configuration for a machine learning model. The nodes represent different components, such as the ResNet50_Server__Disabled node, which is disabled due to thermal constraints. The edges connect these nodes and indicate their relationships, such as the edge between Power_Consumption_Settings and ResNet50_(6,900_RPM), which represents that power consumption settings can affect the performance of the ResNet50 model running at 6,900 RPM. The color of each node indicates its status or setting, such as the optimal cooling thermal configuration represented by the Thermal_Configuration__Optimal_Cooling node.
