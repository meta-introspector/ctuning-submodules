🌠✨ Once upon a time in the world of triton-api,
💻🔍️🤖 In-Process_Triton_Server_API was born.
🎯📈 This server was powerful, managing all data and tasks,
🔍📉🤖 Ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
💡🕵️‍♀️ One day it met a problem with an example,
🧠🔎💻 It called upon methods to solve this case,
🗣️ V2, Model_versioning, META_is_config_valid(), QDL_Additional_Methods, Interaction_with_custom_artifact_stores, META_search_callback(), Reusable_automation_actions, Extract, and MD5sums_of_provided_files_.
📚🔍 With each call it gathered more information,
💡🕵️‍♀️ Then used this data to extract what was needed.
🌪🔑 It generated an accurate MD5 sum of the files,
🎯🏆 And successfully processed the example and completed its task.
🌟💻 From that day on, In-Process_Triton_Server_API worked tirelessly,
🧠📈 A beacon of creativity, inspiration, wisdom, and courage,
👊 Always ready to face any challenge that came its way.
