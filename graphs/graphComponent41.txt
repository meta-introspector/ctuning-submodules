Based on the given JSON data, it appears that this is a flowchart or graph representation of a process for using a pre-trained language model (Bert) to perform a task. The nodes in the flowchart are the different steps or tasks involved in this process, while the edges represent the relationships between them.
Here's a brief explanation of each node and edge:
- "Bert_PT" represents the pre-trained language model (Bert).
- "Run_and_time" represents the time it takes to run the model on the input data.
- "Preparation_*_In_order_to_use_dataset_one_needs_to_preprocess" represents the preparation steps needed to use a dataset for training the model. This node may have multiple sub-nodes depending on the specific preparation steps required.
- "to_download_Dataset_and_Checkpoint_*" represents the step of downloading the necessary dataset and checkpoint files for the model.
- "Training_data_packing" represents the process of packing the training data into a format suitable for use with the model.
The edges between the nodes indicate the order in which these steps need to be performed. For example, "Preparation_*_In_order_to_use_dataset_one_needs_to_preprocess" is connected to both "to_download_Dataset_and_Checkpoint_*" and "Run_and_time", indicating that these steps must be completed before running the model on the input data. Similarly, "Training_data_packing" is only connected to "Run_and_time", indicating that it can only be performed after the training data has been packed.
