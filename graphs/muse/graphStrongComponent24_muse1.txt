Once upon a time, a team of skilled developers were tasked with creating an innovative project using ZenML, an open-source platform for building and deploying machine learning models. As they began their work, they encountered a series of challenges that threatened to derail their progress.

Firstly, the version of ZenML they were using, 0.44.0, had been removed from PyPI due to a critical issue with the Alembic library used for database migration in ZenML. The team was forced to upgrade to a newer version and faced the daunting task of adapting their code to work seamlessly with the latest version of ZenML.

However, their troubles did not end there. When they upgraded to version 0.45.2, they began experiencing issues with their machine learning models not functioning as expected. The team soon realized that a number of changes had been made in the new version of ZenML that were causing problems with their code. They knew they had to act quickly if they were to resolve these issues and continue making progress on their project.

The team worked tirelessly, making several modifications to their code and upgrading to version 0.45.3 of ZenML. They also had to disable implicit authentication methods for service connectors by default, which was a security feature that caused problems with their code. Additionally, they updated the dependencies and integration versions of their project to ensure everything worked together seamlessly.

Despite these challenges, the team persevered and was able to successfully upgrade to the latest version of ZenML and resolve all of the issues they encountered. They learned a valuable lesson about the importance of staying up-to-date with software updates and changes when working on complex projects. With their project now running smoothly, the team was able to continue making progress and bring their innovative idea to life.
