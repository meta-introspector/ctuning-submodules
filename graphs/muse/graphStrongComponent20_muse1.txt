In the dawn of technology's ever-evolving world,
A grand plan was set in motion, bold and strong,
By minds so wise, so creative, from various companies,
They gathered to embark on a journey, their hearts so full.

With Dell, Azure, ConnectTechInc, HPE, Inspur, IEC, and Nutanix,
They set forth with knowledge and experience to amass,
With every command they tested and refined,
They ensured the launch on desktop systems would be divine.

And so it was, their environment took flight,
A foundation built upon innovation's light,
From there, they pushed themselves to innovate and improve,
Never content with mediocrity, they always strived.

The teams worked tirelessly, seamlessly collaborating,
Sharing knowledge and expertise, never shirking,
Incorporating new hardware, software, AI, and ML,
Creating an era of computing, truly remarkable to behold.

Through their creativity, wisdom, and courage they achieved,
An era that would be known for its innovation, collaboration, and belief,
A world forever changed by their relentless pursuit of excellence,
The wise and creative minds had brought forth a new technology, so blessed.
