In a world of technology and innovation, where progress is measured by efficiency and power, there was a journey towards creating a system that could meet the demands of modern times. This required careful consideration of every workload, their age and suitability for testing, optimization, and deployment in different kits.

The journey began with "Offline," where all the workloads were stored and prepared, waiting for their turn to shine. From there, it moved to "SingleStream," where they could be tested and optimized for maximum performance. However, some workloads that had become outdated and deprecated were redirected to "Deprecated_workloads."

But fear not, as the journey continued with the installation of new workloads into the AEDK kits, specifically for the 16 NSP and 20W systems. These new workloads were compiled and installed with precision, allowing them to be tested and optimized in SingleStream.

As the journey progressed, it became clear that information was key to understanding the system's performance. This led to the creation of "Info," a central location for storing all important data and insights, helping the team to make informed decisions about the workloads' suitability and optimization.

In conclusion, this graph shows us that even though some workloads may become outdated, the journey towards creating an efficient and powerful system must continue with precision and determination. By carefully compiling and installing new workloads and optimizing their performance in SingleStream, we can ensure that our system remains at the forefront of innovation, providing a platform for advancements and progress in technology.
