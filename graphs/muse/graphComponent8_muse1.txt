In the land of cloud computing, there was a quest for an environment that could run AI applications with efficiency and power. The journey began with just one click, as users started the process of creating instances on Google Cloud Platform. As they embarked on this mission, they encountered many challenges and obstacles, but their determination never wavered.

As the first step, they moved the main AI pages from their previous location to a more organized space. This allowed them to have a clearer view of their work and made it easier to manage the configuration files. They had to ensure that all necessary dependencies were met, so they carefully reviewed every file and configuration to make sure everything was in order.

The next steps involved downloading the required files and organizing them in the appropriate folders. The system environment variables also needed to be configured, enabling users to work with the latest version of TensorRT software. They had to pay close attention to each detail, ensuring that every component was working together seamlessly.

Finally, a comprehensive tutorial was created to guide users through the entire process of setting up their workstations and using TensorRT on Google Cloud instances. This tutorial included detailed explanations of each step, with examples that helped users understand how to use the software effectively. With these resources available, users could easily set up their workstations and start producing better results faster.

Throughout this journey, the users remained committed to achieving a more efficient and effective workflow. They knew that by following the sequence of steps outlined in the graph, they would be able to achieve their quest and produce amazing results. And so, with determination and creativity, they succeeded in creating a powerful and efficient environment for running AI applications on Google Cloud Platform.
