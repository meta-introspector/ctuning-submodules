Once upon a time, in the land of cloud computing, there was a quest to set up a powerful and efficient environment for running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The journey began with a single click, which started the process of creating instances on Google Cloud Platform. 

As the first step, the main AI pages were moved from their previous location to a new and more organized space. This was followed by managing the configuration files, ensuring that all necessary dependencies were met. 

The next steps involved downloading the required files, organizing them in the appropriate folders, and configuring the system environment variables. The process of configuring TensorRT and other components was also carried out, enabling users to work with the latest version of the software. 

Finally, a comprehensive tutorial was created that outlined all the necessary steps for setting up the Google Cloud instances and working with TensorRT on Windows. This tutorial included detailed explanations of each step, as well as examples that helped users understand how to use the software effectively. 

With these new resources available, users can now easily set up their workstations and start using TensorRT on Google Cloud instances. They will also be able to learn more about the different components that make up TensorRT and how they interact with each other. By following the sequence of steps outlined in the graph, users can achieve a more efficient and effective workflow that helps them produce better results faster.
