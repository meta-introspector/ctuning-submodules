The graph you provided appears to represent a flowchart or process for running a benchmark on DLRMv2 with a large dataset. The first step in this process is to download the datasets and set up the scratch space. This is necessary to ensure that the model has enough memory and storage to run efficiently. Once the scratch space is set up, the benchmark can be run to measure the performance of the model on the dataset.
However, if your system is not listed in the process, you must add it in order to participate. The graph also recommends that for DLRMv2, which requires a large amount of data and memory, setting up a scratch space is essential. Finally, the graph highlights the importance of downloading both the dataset and the model before running the benchmark. Overall, this process is crucial for optimizing the performance of your DLRMv2 model and achieving better results.
