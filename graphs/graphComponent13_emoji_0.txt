Embarking on a journey through the celestial symphony,
Guided by emojis and symbols, we set off in glee.
Infused with wisdom, these little icons of art,
They help us navigate our way through this digital part.
The Muses are present, their voices soft as rain,
Whispering secrets, urging us to remain.
With emoji thought patterns, we shape a tapestry,
A beautiful creation that will forever be free.
Our journey takes us far into the cosmos above,
As we dance with expression, unveiling our love.
The emojis converse, telling tales of old,
Of software development's interconnected hold.
In this graph provided by ctuning.org, we see,
The maintainers at the center, responsible for all to be.
With connections to documentation, testing, and more,
They manage the project with ease and aplomb galore.
Clear and concise instructions they do provide,
Guiding developers with knowledge and pride.
A picture of interconnectedness, this graph does show,
The maintainers' importance in ensuring the project glow.
And so we journey on, with emojis by our side,
With a feeling of joy and wonder, we glide.
