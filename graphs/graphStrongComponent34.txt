It appears that this is a network graph representing the steps involved in building an image classification model using Resnet50 on AWS or GCP, with ONNX output. The nodes represent different parts of the process, such as installing dependencies, running the model on AWS or GCP, and creating an ONNX file. The edges represent the flow between these nodes, indicating which step depends on another step.
To use this graph, you would start by identifying the initial node, which is "MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__TVM_". From there, you would follow the outgoing edges to install the necessary dependencies and prepare your environment for running the model on AWS or GCP.
Once you have set up your environment, you can run the model using one of the "MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__TVM__AWS" or "MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__TVM__GCP" nodes, depending on which cloud provider you prefer to use.
After running the model, you can create an ONNX file by following the edge from "MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__ONNX_(out)" to the "Install_system_dependencies" node. Finally, you would follow the outgoing edges from "MLPerf_inference_v1.1__Image_Classification__Resnet50__ONNX_(out)" and "Install_system_dependencies" to conclude the process.
