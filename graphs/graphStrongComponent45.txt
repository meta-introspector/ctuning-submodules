This is a GraphQL query that represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of software components and their relationships. The nodes represent different types of software components such as relevant files, version numbers, or containers with specific images and tags, and the edges represent the flow of data or dependencies between these components.

The nodes have various properties such as color, id, label, and shape. In this case, all the nodes are colored in blue (#97c2fc) and have a label that describes their type. The shapes are represented as dots.

The edges have an id property that uniquely identifies each edge, as well as from and to properties that specify the source and destination node of the edge.

Overall, this graph provides a visual representation of the software components and their relationships, which can be useful for analyzing dependencies and making informed decisions about how to modify or update the system.
