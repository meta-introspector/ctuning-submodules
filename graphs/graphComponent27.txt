The graph above is a visual representation of the different steps involved in launching an environment on NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson systems. The nodes represent different tasks or processes, while the edges show how they are connected to each other.
Starting with the "notes\_*/" node, it appears that this is where you would begin by reading through some notes to get a better understanding of what's involved in launching an environment on these systems. From there, you can move on to building the binaries, which involves compiling and linking your code into executables that can run on the target hardware.
Once the binaries are built, you can then move on to launching the environment on a MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) instance or a Jetson Orin system. These systems are capable of running multiple instances of your application at once, allowing for better performance and scalability. The graph shows two different types of Jetson systems - Orin and AGX/NX, which are likely to have different capabilities and requirements when it comes to launching an environment.
Finally, you may want to read further on some additional topics related to launching an environment on NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson systems. This could include things like power management and performance tuning, as well as best practices for deploying your application in a production environment.
Overall, the graph above represents a comprehensive roadmap for launching an environment on NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson systems. By following this path, you can ensure that your application runs smoothly and efficiently on these powerful hardware platforms.
