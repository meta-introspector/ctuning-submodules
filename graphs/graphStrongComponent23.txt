As you can see, this graph represents a comprehensive process of deploying a machine learning model. The first step is to use a repository instead of the traditional file system for storing and managing your code and data. This allows for better version control and collaboration between team members.
Next, you need to find the registry URI to configure RBAC (role-based access control) for your project. RBAC allows you to define roles and permissions for users and groups, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information.
Once you've configured RBAC, it's time to use the system to deploy your model. The graph shows several flavors of artifact stores, data validators, experiment trackers, and infrastructure deployment options. You can choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.
Finally, you need to experiment with different configurations and settings to optimize your model's performance and accuracy. The graph provides a wealth of information on how to do this, from finding the right registry URI to using the right artifact store flavor.
In summary, deploying a machine learning model requires careful planning, attention to detail, and a willingness to experiment and adapt as needed. With the right tools and processes in place, however, you can create a powerful and effective system that delivers accurate results and drives business growth.
